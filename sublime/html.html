					When thinking about something interesting about yourself, reflect on your previous life experiences. You may realize that you did something special or developed a useful, unique skill. For example, you may remember a trip you went on where you learned how to surf. Sharing this fun fact may show that you are open to adventure and trying new things.

					Choose an interesting fact that's at least somewhat relevant to the job you're interviewing for. Talking about an interesting travel experience can show you are open to new things. Sharing a unique skill can show that you enjoy ongoing learning. Find a way to answer this icebreaker by showcasing how it relates to your strengths and abilities. When picking your interesting fact, think of how it reflects on you as a person and a professional.

					Asking "Tell me something interesting about yourself" is a simple way for employers to get to know your personality. Pick something that is fun and memorable to share. You can even incorporate a little humor in your answer. The main thing to remember is to keep it fun and professional. You are talking to an employer, so only share things that are work appropriate.
