Technology has put spectacular tools and resources in our hands to make our lives ever so convenient. New findings in the technical field are so frequent that it has become hard for many to catch up with the pace of inventions.As fascinating as these technical wonders seem today, the stories behind them are even more interesting. Here are ten such amazing little known facts about the technology we all use almost every day.

					<code>The world’s first computer mouse was invented at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the 1960s.</code> The equipment was called “X-Y position indicator for displays”.Douglas Engelbart and Bill English are credited with the invention of the mouse. The story that Xerox APAC invented the mouse is a myth. Engelbart demoed the mouse first time in 1968 using the Xerox Alto computer. He termed the demo as ‘Mother of all demos”.The name ‘Mouse' was coined for the instrument as the cable sticking out of it reminded Engelbart of a rodent’s tail.

					<code>Larry Page wanted to sell Google to Excite in 1999. The deal was stuck around $750,000 and 1% of Excite.</code> But then the deal fell apart. Today Google’s Market cap is over $700 billion. There are two versions of the story around why Excite did not buy Google at that time.As per the then Excite CEO George Bell, he rejected the deal because Larry Page insisted that Excite should replace all its search technology with Google’s search technology.However, as per the details given by Steven Levy in his book ‘In The Plex’ George Bell was not very happy with Google’s search algorithm’s excellent performance. Bell thought Google’s relevant search results might take the users away to other websites, which means it will be harder to retain the users on their own Excite webpages.

					<code>Do you know your Apple product can lose its warranty if you smoke near them?</code> Apple has the policy to safeguard their technicians from any toxic work environment. Tobacco tars settled on the systems are considered harmful. Hence, Apple can deny servicing your product even if they are in warranty if they believe that the product has come in contact with tobacco smoke.There is no warranty void clause written in the product documents. But there are numerous instances where the company has refused to honor the warranty on a product that has been exposed to smoke. People have detailed their experiences with not be able to claim warranty repair on their Apple products due to findings of tobacco tars settled on the parts.If you want to stay safe and have a valid warranty on your Apple products, don’t let people smoke near any of them.

					<code>Do you know that you can code using just whitespaces?</code> The programming language that makes it possible is called ‘Whitespace’. All it takes to write a program in this language is to use the spaces, tabs, and linefeeds. The interpreter ignores any non-whitespace characters.Copy the whole code from my gist file and execute it to check for yourself. It is as easy as copy the lines from #3 to #70, go to this site, paste it in the ‘code’ block, and hit Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd +Enter (Mac) on your keyboard to find the output. It is super cool, right! You can use this to write programs that no one can read or understand unless they know that there is something written on a seemingly blank notepad.
